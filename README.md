# Simple Mood State Machine
By Luis Sanchez
  
This assignment uses the p5.js library and JavaScript to simulate a state machine that shows
transitions between different moods.

There are a total of 8 moods in the state machine, and each mood has 3 transitional statements
that map to another mood. 

### How to Use The State Machine
The transitional statements will be displayed under a mood drawing,
and they can be selected using the left/right arrow keys to scroll through the options and the
space/enter/return key to select an option. Once an option has been selected, the canvas will
update to display the mood mapped to that transition and that mood's corresponding transitional statements.
